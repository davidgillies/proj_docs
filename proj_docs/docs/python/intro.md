# Python

This documentation deals with Python 2.  Full documentation visit [python.org](http://python.org).

## Installation

I'm not going to drone on about installation as we are restricted to using Anaconda.  Best to install a version from the folder below, don't use the Anaconda3 stuff which is for Python 3:

P:/Install/Anaconda/

You can install a version of Python 3 that will work without affecting your Python 2 Anaconda, details [here](extras.md#python3)

This documentation will go through the basics in minimal detail.  The aim is not to get bogged down in jargon and complexity and instead focus on the actual use of Python, in particular in ways related to the projects.  Other sources will be listed where you can put meat on the bones if you choose to.

## IDEs
You can use Anaconda's Spyder IDE that cokes with Anaconda.  It automatically detects PEP8 code which is a nice feature, but is limited in other ways.  You can use [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) which can be downloaded as an executable, which you can just double click on to start up.  It has some nice features and a very flexible layout. 

##Python Prompt
Open a command prompt and just type

    python

This will open the python prompt for you. You can write python code directly at this prompt.  To close it type Ctrl-Z.

Now you can move on to the next topic by pressing 'Next' in the top right of the screen.
