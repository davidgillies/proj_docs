# Project Documentation

These docs contain some tutorials and info on many subjects related to Python and the Web.  There are not meant to cover everything and indeed aim at providing a set of basic practical skills and knowledge that will help you understand the python universe better.  Complex topics will only be covered in depth where they impact on the projects.

Docs have white boxes that denote code that can be run either at prompts or as scripts.
